# Arduino-Radio-Control

This project aims to enable full control of radios that do not have front panel programming, ie, commercial radios.

Features on the the wish list:
* web browswer and IOS/Andriod apps for control of radio
* command structure to accept Kenwood commands, this is to enable control of the radio from MANY amateur radio repeater controllers, and native support for Allstarlink distrobutions starting with ACID
